    <p>Opening in the heart of Manhattan—just blocks from Madison Square Park—Milu is a lively hub for friends, family, and neighbors who share a passion for Chinese cuisine. 

        Milu was born of an enthusiastic exploration of Chinese regional cuisines and a desire to share the flavors we came to love. Our menu is personal, reflecting memories of childhood, travel, and beloved family recipes. Refined by our many years in fine dining and hospitality, Milu is a collective return to the comforting dishes we love to make, eat, and share.</p>
